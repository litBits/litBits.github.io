	<h1>litBits Home Page</h1>
	<h2>Welcome reader!</h2>
	<p>This site is a guide for a project called litBits. The purpose of litBits is to introduce basic concepts of electrical engineering and computer science. So, whether you're a student, teacher, or just a curious george, I'm glad you're here.</p>
	<p>It's important to start by reading the background information before setting anything up. It may also be helpful to look over the material on the tools/reference page; it's chock-full materials that will help during any point in your project.</p>
	<p>After reading, setup can begin. Head over to the section on hardware and follow along to build the contraption. Then, it's on to software. Here you'll check that the contraption is working properly and write up the litBits code. Finally, go to the section on user implementaion to learn how to interact with the program and hadware.</p>
	<p>When you've completed the entire project, pat yourself on the back. Being able to connect different concpets together, let alone understand them enough to implement them, is tough! Many people don't learn about any of this until their freshman year of college.</p>
	<p>For those interested in more information click on the "Explore More" tab. There you'll find links to webpages and resources related to electrial engineering and computer science.</p>
